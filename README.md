# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The example code attempts to access a user by ID, but fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid number, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code.  `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that includes comprehensive error handling.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` and test with both valid and invalid user IDs. Observe the difference in behavior.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` and test with the same user IDs. Note the improved error handling.
